I’ve bounced between quite a few note-taking apps, yet finding one that is local-first, visually polished, and deeply integrated with AI is surprisingly hard. Before returning to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) again, I spent about two years with [Craft.do](https://www.craft.do/). They really pushed Mac Catalyst to its limits, but the sluggish AI updates still made me grit my teeth and walk away. `In the AI era, the best way to organize notes is back to markdown files; working with files directly lets agents reach their full potential.` I pair Obsidian with Infio, which weaves my notes together into a genuinely connected knowledge base.

You could replicate something similar with VS Code plus any agent, but Obsidian offers a more complete ecosystem: the visual styling notes need, backlinks, and more. The mobile version of Obsidian is much weaker, so when I’m away from my desk I switch to [Termius](https://termius.com/index.html) to SSH into my home server and work on notes with a command-line agent. It also saves me from worrying about synchronization.
