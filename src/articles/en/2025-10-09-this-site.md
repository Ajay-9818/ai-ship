That's right — the website you're looking at is a pure product of [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). I didn't write a single line of code. Modern programming agent AIs `handle frontend tasks with remarkable ease`, and Codex offers one of the best cost-performance ratios today. From planning to implementation, it has practically taken care of everything.

After a few vibe coding projects “from-scratch”, I’ve realized that clarifying requirements before actually starting might be the key to success. Take [the very first commit of this project](https://github.com/onevcat/ai-ship/commit/2ec4f2f6847b737568c1be82847d769d25357d97) as an example — this kind of “plan-driven development” could well be the go-to paradigm for kicking off new projects in the AI era (and of course, that plan itself was also generated by an LLM).
