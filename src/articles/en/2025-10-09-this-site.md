That's right — the website you're looking at is a pure product of [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). I didn't write a single line of code. Modern programming agent AIs handle frontend tasks with remarkable ease, and Codex offers one of the best cost-performance ratios today. From planning to implementation, it has practically taken care of everything.
