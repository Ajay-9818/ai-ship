A self-hosted n8n instance can really boost happiness. I run one on my home server, where a scheduled task triggers every morning to fetch the weather for today and tomorrow along with calendar of all family members. Then, with AI integration, it generates clothing suggestions and a daily schedule, wraps it up with a warm greeting and a short motivational note, and finally delivers it to my all my families via Bark â€” the perfect way to start the day.
